# Views and thresholds

## Custom views

Define table columns for any resource. Most useful for custom resources, which
otherwise fall back to NAME/AGE. sofka keys views by apiVersion/plural
(`"cert-manager.io/v1/certificates"`, `"v1/pods"`), group/plural, bare plural, or
lowercase kind. The most specific key wins.

```toml
[views."cert-manager.io/v1/certificates"]
sort = "EXPIRES:desc"     # initial sort column, ":asc" (default) or ":desc";
                          # a sort you pick in the TUI (S/I/header click) is
                          # remembered per kind and wins over this
# replace = true          # replace the curated columns instead of overlaying

[[views."cert-manager.io/v1/certificates".columns]]
name = "READY"
path = "Ready"            # the condition *type* name, found wherever it is
type = "condition"        # in the array — order isn't guaranteed by anything

[[views."cert-manager.io/v1/certificates".columns]]
name = "EXPIRES"
path = "/status/notAfter"
type = "time"             # rendered as elapsed ("3d4h") / "in 30d"

[[views."cert-manager.io/v1/certificates".columns]]
name = "ISSUER"
path = "/spec/issuerRef/name"
wide = true               # only shown in wide mode (`w`)
```

`path` is a JSON Pointer (RFC 6901) into the object as the API serves it:
`/metadata/…`, `/spec/…`, `/status/…`, and array indices like
`/spec/ports/0/port`.

`type` is `text` (default), `status`, `number`, `quantity` (`500m`, `1Gi`),
`time`, or `condition`. Typed columns sort by value, not by text.

For a `condition` column, `path` is the condition **type name** (`Ready`,
`Available`, `Reconciling`, …). sofka finds it in `status.conditions` by name -
never by array index, whose order nothing guarantees - renders its `status`
(`True`/`False`/`Unknown`), and colors the row like a `status` column.

Optional `width` (for fixed columns) and `align` (`left`/`center`/`right`) tune
the layout. By default columns overlay the curated ones: a matching header
replaces it in place, new columns go before AGE. Invalid entries are skipped with
a warning in the app - they never take down the TUI.

### Pods and nodes

Custom columns also overlay sofka's curated core-resource views. Pods already
show `IP` and `NODE` after toggling wide mode with `w`, and nodes always show
`VERSION`. Press `w` in the nodes view to show `LABELS` as comma-separated
`key=value` pairs in key order. Nodes without labels show `<none>`.
Use `/` to find text in the visible labels. To filter by an exact label, press
`/`, enter `-l karpenter.sh/nodepool=default`, then press Enter. Label selectors
also work with wide mode off. Use the label key and value for your cluster.

Custom columns can show individual labels or annotations. Extra node topology
and provisioning details can come from labels:

```toml
# Karpenter example; adjust provider-specific NODEPOOL and TYPE label names.
[views."v1/nodes"]

[[views."v1/nodes".columns]]
name = "NODEPOOL"
path = "/metadata/labels/karpenter.sh~1nodepool"

[[views."v1/nodes".columns]]
name = "ZONE"
path = "/metadata/labels/topology.kubernetes.io~1zone"

[[views."v1/nodes".columns]]
name = "INSTANCE"
path = "/metadata/labels/node.kubernetes.io~1instance-type"

[[views."v1/nodes".columns]]
name = "TYPE"
path = "/metadata/labels/karpenter.sh~1capacity-type"
```

In a JSON Pointer, `/` inside a label name must be escaped as `~1`. For example,
EKS commonly uses `eks.amazonaws.com~1nodegroup` for `NODEPOOL` and
`eks.amazonaws.com~1capacityType` for `TYPE`. Add `wide = true` to any custom
column that should appear only after pressing `w`.

### Navigating between kinds

sofka's drill-downs are relationships between kinds, expressed as a watch
selector: `enter` on a Deployment lists pods under its `matchLabels`, `enter`
on a Node lists pods with `spec.nodeName` equal to its name, `o` on a pod opens
the node named in `spec.nodeName`. Those relationships are built in for core
kinds. Custom resources relate to each other the same way - an operator's
parent object owns children it labels, a claim names the node it became - but
sofka can't know a CRD's field layout in advance. A view can declare the
relationship, and `enter`/`o` then work exactly as they do for core kinds:
push the current view, open the target scoped to the row, `esc` to come back.

Two shapes cover most cases.

**A row names one node** - `node` is a JSON Pointer to the field holding the
node's name. `o` jumps to that node, and so does `enter` for a kind with no
drill-down of its own. Pods (`/spec/nodeName`) and Karpenter NodeClaims
(`/status/nodeName`) are built in; `node` adds a kind or overrides a built-in.
This is what the NodeClaim row amounts to:

```toml
[views."karpenter.sh/v1/nodeclaims"]
node = "/status/nodeName"
```

The nodes list is scoped by `metadata.name`, the only field selector the
apiserver indexes for nodes, so the pointer has to land on a name. A row whose
pointer is empty (the node isn't assigned yet) warns instead of opening an empty
list; a pointer that lands on something other than a string warns that the
pointer is wrong.

**A row selects other objects** - `drill` names the kind `enter` should open and
how to scope it: a label selector (`labels`), a field selector (`fields`), or
both, with `{name}` and `{namespace}` filled in from the row:

```toml
# children carry the parent's name in a label
[views."karpenter.sh/v1/nodepools"]
drill = { kind = "nodeclaims", labels = "karpenter.sh/nodepool={name}" }

# the target is a single object with a known name and nothing labelling it back
[views.externalsecrets]
drill = { kind = "secrets", fields = "metadata.name={name}" }
```

Prefer `labels` when the target carries a label pointing back at the row -
that's how most operators mark what they own. Use `fields` when it doesn't:
`metadata.name` and `metadata.namespace` are selectable on every kind, other
fields only where the apiserver indexes them. `kind` is anything `:` accepts
(alias, plural, or kind) and is resolved when you press `enter`, so an unknown
kind warns and stays put. A namespaced target opens in the row's namespace; a
cluster-scoped one ignores it.

Kinds with a built-in drill-down keep it - a `drill` on pods won't replace the
container picker, and `:config` warns that the stanza is ignored. When a view
sets both `drill` and `node`, `enter` drills and `o` still jumps to the node.

Both settings are resolved key by key across the view keys for a kind
(`apiVersion/plural`, `group/plural`, plural, kind), not off the single most
specific view the way `columns` and `sort` are. A specific view that only sets
columns therefore doesn't hide a `node` or `drill` set under a broader key.

### CRD printer columns

A custom resource with no explicit view picks up its CRD
`additionalPrinterColumns` automatically (columns with `priority > 0` become
wide-only). A condition lookup
(`.status.conditions[?(@.type=="Ready")].status` - how most CRDs express their
READY column) becomes a `condition` column, found by type name. The same filter
selecting another field (`.reason`, `.message`, `.lastTransitionTime`, …) keeps
the column and reads that field from the named condition. Other JSONPath filter
or wildcard expressions aren't representable and those columns are skipped. So
most custom resources get useful columns with zero configuration.

## Thresholds

The warning and critical values behind RESTARTS/CPU/MEM cell color (and the
request/limit utilization in the container picker) are configurable. Anything you
don't set keeps the sofka default, so an empty config colors exactly as before.

Global `[thresholds]` apply everywhere. `[thresholds.resources.<key>]` overrides
per resource (keyed like `[views]`). Like every section, a per-cluster or
per-context override file can retune them for one context. Thresholds re-apply
live on `:reload`.

```toml
[thresholds]
restarts    = { warn = 3, critical = 10 }       # count
cpu         = { warn = "200m", critical = "1" } # absolute usage
memory      = { warn = "256Mi", critical = "1Gi" }
utilization = { warn = 75, critical = 90 }      # percent of request/limit

[thresholds.resources.pods]                     # per-kind override
restarts = { warn = 5, critical = 20 }
```

Omit either bound of a band to disable that level. `warn` is peach, `critical`
is red.
