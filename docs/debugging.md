# Debugging and incident workflow

## Explain unhealthy (`X`)

A deterministic, evidence-based answer to "why is this broken?" for the selected
object: rollout state, degraded conditions, the blocking pods and their container
failure reasons (ImagePullBackOff, CrashLoopBackOff, OOMKilled, unschedulable,
failed probes), and recent Warning events. No AI, no external service.

`j`/`k` move, `⏎` goes to the resource behind a finding, `E` its events, `l` its
logs, `r` gathers again. A finding you can drill into has a trailing `→`.

## Timeline (`T`)

A per-object timestamped log of every state change the watch saw this session:
generation bumps, replica and readiness changes, pod phase, restarts, waiting
reasons, condition flips. Diffed from the watch stream, bounded in size, never
written to disk.

## Diff (`:diff`)

A unified diff of the live object against its `last-applied-configuration`. When
that annotation is missing - as it is for every Flux-, ArgoCD-, or Helm-managed object,
which nothing ever `kubectl apply`s - sofka diffs against the previous revision
this session's watch saw instead, so "what just changed?" has an answer on GitOps
clusters. The last revision of up to 256 changed objects is kept in memory.

## Notifications

`:notify` toggles a notification on the selected object. Sophie watches it so you
don't have to: every state change the watch sees (the same transitions the
timeline records - rollout progress, readiness, phase, restarts, waiting reasons,
conditions) flashes in the status line, rings the terminal bell, and fires a
**desktop notification**.

Each notify is its own bounded single-object watch, so it keeps firing while you
browse other views - "tell me when this rollout finishes" and keep working.
`:notify` on the same row turns it off. Everything is session-local.

```toml
[notify]
bell = true         # ring the terminal bell
desktop = "osc777"  # "osc777" | "osc9" | "both" | "off"
# command = ["notify-send", "sofka", "$MESSAGE"]     # Linux, inside tmux
# command = ["terminal-notifier", "-title", "sofka"] # macOS ($MESSAGE appended)
```

- `osc777` (default) - rxvt-style title+body, the form Ghostty recommends. Also
  kitty, WezTerm, foot, urxvt.
- `osc9` - iTerm2-style body-only, for iTerm2 and Windows Terminal, which speak
  only that.
- `both` and `off` are also valid. Terminals ignore protocols they don't speak.

Inside a **terminal multiplexer**, which swallows escape sequences from its panes,
set `command` to run a local notifier subprocess instead (`$MESSAGE` is
substituted as a whole argument, never through a shell).

In a **herdr** pane no config is needed at all: sofka detects the pane
environment and delivers through `herdr notification show`, so the toast follows
herdr's own `ui.toast` delivery (in-app, outer terminal, or system).

## Log controls

The kubelet logs view (`l`) keeps a bounded follow buffer. Tune the initial tail,
the buffer size, and an optional `since` lookback:

```toml
[logs]
tail = 300         # initial lines fetched per stream (kubectl --tail)
buffer = 5000      # max lines kept while following (oldest dropped)
since = "1h"       # optional: only logs newer than this — replaces tail
fullscreen = false # open log views fullscreen (F toggles per session)
```

In the view, `/` filters with a case-insensitive substring, a `/regex/`, or a
leading `!` to invert (keep lines that don't match). A malformed regex is flagged
instead of hiding everything. `z` clears the on-screen buffer while the live
stream keeps appending. A pod streams every container's logs at once. Full keymap:
[Logs view](keys.md#logs-view).

For history that outlives the pod, use [VictoriaLogs](providers.md#log-provider-victorialogs).

## Debug containers and pods

`:debug` on a **pod** attaches a temporary ephemeral debug container with
`kubectl debug`. sofka prompts for the image (prefilled from `[debug]`). An empty
`command` starts an interactive shell (bash if the image has it, else sh), like
the pod shell. `d` in the container picker sets `--target=<container>` so the
debug container shares that container's process namespace. The ephemeral
container stays on the pod until the pod is recreated - Kubernetes can't remove
it, so there's nothing for sofka to clean up.

`:debug` on a **node** starts a privileged diagnostic pod on it
(`kubectl debug node/<node>`, image `node_image` in `node_namespace`, optional
`node_profile`). That pod mounts the host filesystem at `/host` and joins the host
PID, network, and IPC namespaces, so sofka previews exactly that access and makes
you confirm before creating it. sofka records the node debuggers it started this
session and `:debug-clean` deletes them (matched by the `node-debugger-*` name and
the node). kubectl leaves the pod behind after you exit, so clean up when you're
done.

```toml
[debug]
image = "nicolaka/netshoot:latest"       # ephemeral (in-pod) debug image
command = ["bash"]                       # entrypoint; omit for an interactive shell
node_image = "nicolaka/netshoot:latest"  # node debug pod image
node_namespace = "default"               # namespace the node debugger lands in
node_profile = "sysadmin"                # kubectl debug --profile (optional)
```

Read-only mode and [guardrails](safety.md#guardrails) gate both actions: the
`debug` action for pods, `node-debug` for nodes. Both are recorded in the
[journal](safety.md#action-journal).

## Diagnostic bundles

`:bundle` assembles a redacted incident bundle for the selected object - its YAML,
the owner, the incident explanation, recent events, the session timeline, bounded
recent logs, and a metrics snapshot - into one Markdown document. It's for handing
an incident between application and platform teams. sofka gathers it off-thread
and shows a preview, then `:bundle-save` writes it to a temp file.

Always redacted: Secret `data`/`stringData` values, any credential-like
annotation (a key containing `token`, `password`, `secret`, `apikey`,
`credential`, and similar), and `last-applied-configuration`, all replaced with a
placeholder. `managedFields` is dropped. Env vars sourced from Secrets are flagged
(their values are references, not literals). Every bundle carries a manifest of
exactly what it includes and what it withholds.

```toml
[bundle]
anonymize = false   # replace context/cluster identity with placeholders
log_lines = 200     # max recent log lines per pod
max_pods = 3        # cap how many pods contribute logs
```

## Snapshots

`:snapshot` captures the current table view - its columns and visible rows, plus
metadata (context, cluster, namespace, resource, filter, timestamp) - to a file.
An optional argument sets the format: `text` (default, an aligned table with a
header block), `json`, or `yaml`. Files land in
`$XDG_STATE_HOME/sofka/snapshots` (or `~/.local/state/sofka/snapshots`).

`:snapshots` browses saved captures, newest first with their age. `⏎` opens one in
a viewer with a staleness banner (it's a point-in-time capture), `d` deletes the
highlighted file.

This is not the one-frame `--snapshot` CI flag - this is an interactive
capture-and-review workflow.

## Runtime diagnostics

`:info` shows the version and build, config sources, live context/cluster/API
server and Kubernetes revision, discovery and Metrics API status, watch error
and reconnect counts, API request latency, the logging destination, and the
state/log/snapshot/bundle directories. It also names the active skin and the
plugins and custom views that loaded.

`sofka info` prints the same report headlessly. It connects briefly - discovery
and Metrics API status are the half of the report that is not on disk - and
still prints everything else if the connection fails:

```sh
sofka info              # connect, report, exit
sofka info --offline    # no connection: build, config, logging, directories
```

`:info` reports the running session's watch error and reconnect counts. A
headless report has no session to count, so it opens one watch instead - the
same resource and namespace a launch would - and reports whether it establishes,
how long the initial sync took, and how many objects it returned. Discovery
working says nothing about whether watches do: a proxy that closes long-lived
connections passes every other check in this report and still leaves the TUI
with an empty table. The probe gives up after 5s, which is itself the answer
when a first view is too slow to be usable.

Identifiers, paths, and counts only, never credentials, tokens, decoded Secret
values, or plugin inputs. Values that could carry a credential - an API server
URL with userinfo, an error string echoing a request header - are redacted
before they are printed.

### Request latency

Every Kubernetes API request is timed and bucketed by class, so "the cluster
feels slow" becomes a number:

```
API request latency
  CLASS        COUNT  ERRORS       AVG       P50       P90       MAX
  discovery        4       0     182ms     262ms     524ms     341ms
  watch           12       0      41.2ms    65.5ms   131ms     118ms
  read            37       1      12.8ms    16.4ms    32.8ms    91.2ms
```

`watch` is time to response headers - the stream itself stays open for the life
of the view. Percentiles are bucket upper bounds (powers of two), so read them
as "at most"; `AVG` and `MAX` are exact. `ERRORS` includes requests canceled
before response headers (for example by a timeout), transport failures, and 5xx
responses. A 4xx response is not counted as a latency error.

### Structured logging

Off by default. Turn it on for one run with `SOFKA_LOG`, or in config:

```toml
[logging]
level       = "info"   # off (default) | error | warn | info | debug | trace
# file      = "/tmp/sofka.log"   # default: <state-dir>/logs/sofka.log
max_size_mb = 8        # rotate to <file>.1 past this size
```

```sh
SOFKA_LOG=debug sofka pods    # overrides [logging] level for one run
tail -f ~/.local/state/sofka/logs/sofka.log
```

Each event is one logfmt line:

```
ts=2026-09-06T18:54:31.845Z level=info event=cluster.connected context=prod cluster=eu-1 kinds=214
ts=2026-09-06T18:54:32.001Z level=info event=watch.start kind=pods ns=default generation=1
ts=2026-09-06T18:54:38.774Z level=warn event=watch.error kind=pods error="too old resource version"
```

`info` covers the session shape - startup, connects, watch starts and re-lists.
`debug` adds one line per API request. `warn` and `error` carry watch failures,
failed requests, state-write failures, and background-task panics.

Every value is redacted on the way in - bearer tokens, kubeconfig credentials,
`key=value` pairs whose key looks like a credential, and URL userinfo - so the
log can be attached to a bug report as it is. Writing happens on its own thread
behind a bounded queue: a stalled filesystem drops lines (counted in `:info`)
rather than stalling the UI.
