# Key reference

The full keymap. `?` inside sofka shows the same thing, including your own
plugin, bookmark, and workspace chords. `:` and `?` work from every navigation
screen; closing either returns to the screen where it was opened. Text-entry
pickers keep both characters available as input.

## Table views

Use `:resource -n namespace --context context /filter` to apply a complete query.
Scope options precede the slash. Structured filter terms combine with spaces or
`&&`, with `||` for OR and `!(...)` for group negation. `/` edits the active filter
and Esc clears it. See [filtering](filtering.md)
for the grammar and selector persistence rules.

## Logs view

`/` filter (substring · `/regex/` · `!invert`) · `s`/`f` autoscroll · `w` wrap ·
`t` timestamps · `x` stop/resume stream · `z` clear buffer · `c` copy buffer ·
`ctrl-s` save to file · `F` fullscreen (no chrome, clean text selection) ·
`0`–`5` time anchors (tail · 1m · 5m · 15m · 30m · 1h) · `T` provider lookback
(VictoriaLogs views) · `esc` back. The newest line anchors to the bottom of the
viewport.

## Document views (YAML, describe, diff, events)

`ctrl-f` / `ctrl-b` page forward or back, with `PgDn` / `PgUp` as aliases.
`/` searches like vim: the whole document stays on screen and every match is
highlighted. `n` / `N` go to the next or previous match. `w` wraps. `c` copies
the document. `esc` backs out - the first press clears an active search. In the
`?` help panel, `/` filters instead and narrows to matching keybinds.

## Explain view (`X`)

`j` / `k` move, `⏎` goes to the resource behind a finding (a blocking pod), `E`
its events, `l` its logs, `r` gathers again, `esc` goes back. After opening
logs or events, one `esc` returns to Explain and another returns to the table. A
finding you can drill into has a trailing `→`.

## Text inputs (palette, filters, prompts)

`ctrl-u` clears the line, `ctrl-w` / `alt-⌫` delete the previous word.

## Palette completion keys

In the `:` palette, `tab`/`↓` and `shift-tab`/`↑` move through the suggestion
list and `⏎` runs the highlighted one. Rebind them under `[keys]` in
`config.toml` — emacs/cmp style, for example:

```toml
[keys]
palette_next   = "ctrl-n"
palette_prev   = "ctrl-p"
palette_accept = ["ctrl-y", "enter"]
```

Each value is one [key chord](plugins.md) or a list of chords, and replaces
the default set for that action (`["tab", "down"]`, `["backtab", "up"]`,
`["enter"]`) — include a default in the list to keep it too. `ctrl-c` (quit)
and `ctrl-e` (compact mode) are reserved by built-ins and can't be bound.

## What suspends the TUI

Interactive actions (`e`, `s` for shell, `a`) suspend the TUI and shell out to
`kubectl`. Delete, scale, restart, set-image, suspend, resume, reconcile, and
port-forward go through the kube API (or a backgrounded process) directly.

## Plugin commands

| Command                            | Action                                                       |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `:<plugin> [name=value ...]`       | Run a plugin with validated inputs.                          |
| `:plugin-cancel`                   | Stop the active plugin run and its temporary forward.        |
| `:sanitize [states=…] [dry_run=…]` | Delete the pods the namespace has finished with (pods view). |

`:sanitize` ships with sofka; see [Sanitize pods](../plugins/sanitize/README.md).
Installed packages add their commands and key chords to `?` help.
Use `:reload` after a package change.
See [Create a plugin package](plugin-authoring.md).
