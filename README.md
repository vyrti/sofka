# sofka

A Kubernetes TUI written in Rust, on [`kube-rs`](https://kube.rs) and
[`ratatui`](https://ratatui.rs). Async everywhere, so the UI never blocks on the
cluster.

**[sofka.rs](https://sofka.rs)** - the website, with a watchable tour of a real
session ([sofka.rs/#play](https://sofka.rs/#play)).

## Why "sofka"

<img src="docs/sophie.png" alt="Sophie, a Russian Blue, watching the screen with visible suspicion" align="right" width="220">

That's Sophie, a Russian Blue. She sits behind the monitor and watches the
screen. Constantly, not sometimes. She has the narrow-eyed look of someone who
has seen a pod in `CrashLoopBackOff`. She catches every state change and doesn't
get distracted. She is, in effect, a cluster watchman that is a cat.

`sofka` is the Serbian short form of Sophia, which means "wisdom". A good cluster
TUI and a good cat both watch things closely, and both know when something is
wrong.

## What it does

sofka is a reimagining of [k9s](https://github.com/derailed/k9s) with one generic
object pipeline instead of a renderer per resource kind. Same purpose, different
architecture. The short version:

- **Every CRD works on day one** - one generic render pipeline, curated columns
  for common kinds, NAME/AGE for the rest, and `enter` on a CRD drills into its
  custom resources.
- **Flux CD built in** - `t` suspends, resumes, and reconciles through native API
  patches. No `flux` binary. Plus a native Helm inspector that decodes release
  Secrets itself.
- **Argo CD built in** - `t` suspends, resumes, and syncs ArgoCD Applications
  and ApplicationSets through native API patches. No `argocd` binary.
- **It tells you why something is broken** - `X` opens a deterministic,
  evidence-based incident view. No AI, no external service.
- **Bulk actions** - `space` marks rows for delete, kill, or Flux actions across
  many resources at once.
- **Port-forwards run in the background** - starting one doesn't freeze the TUI,
  and `:pf` manages them all.
- **Guardrails and read-only mode** - "never delete in prod" is enforced, not
  remembered.
- **Skins** - Catppuccin, Gruvbox, Solarized, Nord, Dracula, Tokyo Night, One
  Dark, Rosé Pine, Rosé Pine Dawn, Monokai, Flexoki, with auto dark/light
  detection.

The [full feature list](docs/features.md) is long. So is the
[comparison with k9s](docs/vs-k9s.md), including why it's faster.

## Installation

Every [release](https://github.com/nklmilojevic/sofka/releases) ships prebuilt
binaries for macOS (aarch64/x86_64) and Linux (aarch64/x86_64).

```sh
brew install nklmilojevic/sofka/sofka   # Homebrew (macOS/Linux)
nix run github:nklmilojevic/sofka       # Nix, nothing to install
cargo install sofka                     # Cargo
```

Or build from source: `cargo build --release` (see
[Development](docs/architecture.md#development)).

### macOS: "cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified"

The release binaries aren't signed or notarized yet, so Gatekeeper refuses a
tarball you downloaded in a browser. Nothing is broken. Clear the quarantine flag
once:

```sh
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine sofka
```

(Or right-click the binary in Finder, pick Open, confirm once.) Signing and
notarization are on the [roadmap](docs/roadmap.md).

## Usage

```
sofka [RESOURCE] [-n NAMESPACE] [-A] [--context NAME] [--kubeconfig PATH] [--readonly | --write]

  RESOURCE          resource to open (alias/plural/kind), default: pods
  -n, --namespace   namespace to start in
  -A, --all-namespaces
  --context         kubeconfig context to start in (default: current context)
  --kubeconfig      kubeconfig file to use (sets $KUBECONFIG for the session)
  --readonly        disable every mutating action for the session
  --write           force write mode, overriding any config `readonly`
```

`--readonly` and `--write` set the mode for the whole session and win over the
config `readonly` option, including per-cluster and per-context overrides, on
every `:ctx` switch. With no flag, switching into a context whose config sets
`readonly = true` enables read-only mode (shown as `[read-only]` in the header),
and switching away restores write mode.

Headless modes need no TTY and double as CI smoke tests:

```sh
sofka --check                # connect, run discovery, print a summary, exit
sofka pods --snapshot        # render one frame of a resource view to stdout
sofka dp -A --snapshot       # deployments, all namespaces
sofka info                   # runtime diagnostics: build, config, discovery, latency, dirs
sofka info --offline         # the same report without connecting to a cluster
```

[full key reference](docs/keys.md).

## Configuration

`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/sofka/config.toml` (or `~/.config/sofka/config.toml`). All
optional - an empty config behaves like no config. `:reload` re-reads it live.

```toml
default_namespace = "kube-system"
default_resource  = "deployments"
readonly          = false
favorite_namespaces = ["kube-system", "monitoring"]

[aliases]
dep = "deployments"

[skin]
name = "gruvbox-dark"   # omit to auto-detect dark/light
```

Any option can be overridden per cluster or per kubeconfig context, so prod can
be read-only in a light skin while everything else stays as is. See the
[configuration reference](docs/configuration.md) for the rest.
